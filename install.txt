Things you need to compile and install.  Most systems don't
have these installed by default.
  gcc and make
  Header files for pam
  Header files for openssl

sudo apt-get install autoconf

sudo ./buildx.sh /opt/X11rdp


You can build sesman without pam, there is a Makefile parameter
for that.
I also have a replacement ssl_calls.c to avoid the openssl dependency
email me(Jay) for it or see http://server1.xrdp.org/xrdp/openssl.
Due to the licence, I can't include it in this project.

http://server1.xrdp.org/xrdp/openssl/

unpackage the tarball

tar -zxvf xrdp-0.1.tar.gz

this will create a folder xrdp

switch to the xrdp folder(cd xrdp)

run make

as root, run make install

This will install most of the files in /usr/local/xrdp.
Some files install in /etc/xrdp.  These are configuation
files.

files and location
/usr/local/xrdp/startwm.sh - script that starts the window manager
  You may need to edit this file to run your window manager.
/etc/sesman.ini - sesman configuration file
/etc/rsakeys.ini - rsa stuff
/etc/xrdp.ini - xrdp configuration file
/var/run/sesman.pid
/var/rub/xrdp.pid

Sesman and xrdp both have to be running as root.
You should set them to start when the system starts.
You can use xrdp_control.sh script to start them.

To completely remove xrdp
  remove directory /usr/local/xrdp
  remove directory /etc/xrdp
  remove file /var/run/xrdp.pid
  remove file /var/run/sesman.pid
  remove any startup links added to /etc/init.d or /etc/rcX.d
